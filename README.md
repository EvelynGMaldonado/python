# python

1. Python documentation uses single quotes, we can use single or double, we just need to keep it consistent.

2. Most programmers and programming languages start counting from zero (0).

3. List --> a way of containing values all in the same place / variable. 
        --> it is represented by square brackets [] and the values are separated by comma (,).

4. while True --> a way of deliverately inducing a loop that by default is going to go forever.
