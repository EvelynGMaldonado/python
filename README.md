# python

1. Python documentation uses single quotes, we can use single or double, we just need to keep it consistent.

2. Most programmers and programming languages start counting from zero (0).

3. List --> a way of containing values all in the same place / variable. 
        --> it is represented by square brackets [] and the values are separated by comma (,).

4. while True --> a way of deliverately inducing a loop that by default is going to go forever.

5. Dictionaries (dict) --> data structure that allows us to associate one value with another. 
                       --> it is represented by curly braces {}, and it contains keys and values
                       --> {"key": "value"} associated by colon (:), and separated by comma (,).

6. Return --> is even stronger than break, it won't only break out of a loop, but it will also return a value for us.

7. NameError --> variables that we meant to define but somehow we didn't.

8. Accessing List Items:
        Indexing --> [0] access to the first item of the list
                 --> [1] access to the second item of the list
                 -->[-1] access to the last item of the list
                 -->[-2] access to the second last item of the list
